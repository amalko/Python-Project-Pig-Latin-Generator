# Python-Project-Pig-Latin-Generator
Here, an input is accepted from the user and the corresponding pig latin code is generated. 

General description:
Pig latin is a kind of a secret code. 

Coding process:
If a  word starts with a vowel, then we need to add "ay" to the end of the word to generate its pig latin code.
If a word does not start with a vowel, then we need to remove its first alphabet and add it to its last and then add "ay" to its end to generate its pig latin code.

Examples:
word (doesn't start with a vowel) ----> ordway (Pig Latin Code)
apple(starts with a vowel) ----> appleay (Pig Latin Code)
